# friends-Hangman
a small python project which resembles to the HANGMAN game. But instead of having English words, the list of words to be guessed comprises of a couple of my friends name. pretty fun project apparently.
to be more benevolent and reduce the level of difficulty (͡ ° ͜ʖ ͡ °), the list contains the following names:-
"shreyas","nishant","nikhil","shravan","vedant","shivam","chetan"
would like to add more but seems like im running short on friends irl.
